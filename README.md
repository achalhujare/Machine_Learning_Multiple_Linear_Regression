ðŸ¤– Multiple Linear Regression & Model Evaluation in ML

This Jupyter Notebook provides a complete walkthrough of applying machine learning models to a structured and preprocessed dataset. It acts as a practical guide to training, evaluating, and comparing models using widely used Python libraries.

ðŸ“Œ Workflow Overview:

ðŸ”¹ Library Imports
Leverages popular libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

ðŸ”¹ Data Loading
Reads the prepared dataset and explores its structure through descriptive statistics and data inspection.

ðŸ”¹ Train-Test Split
Divides the dataset using train_test_split to create training and testing subsets.

ðŸ”¹ Model Building
Includes the implementation of various classification models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

ðŸ”¹ Training & Prediction
Fits models on training data and performs predictions on test data.

ðŸ”¹ Evaluation Metrics
Assesses model performance using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Visual plots (if included)

ðŸ”¹ Model Comparison
Compares the output of all models to determine the most effective based on chosen metrics.

ðŸ›  Setup Requirements:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

ðŸ’¡ Perfect For:

Learners getting hands-on experience with core ML models
Students building machine learning projects
Anyone looking to demonstrate a full machine learning pipeline from data to evaluation
